        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we use personal data</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We are the Environment Agency and we are the official authority for issuing fishing licences in England (except the River Tweed), Wales and the Border Esk region of Scotland. We are the controller for personal data collected and processed for our Get a fishing licence service. A data controller determines how and why personal data (personal information) is processed.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">Children under the age of 13 do not require a licence and you should not provide us with their personal data. If you are not the angler and you are providing us with someone else’s personal data to apply for a licence on their behalf, please make them aware of this privacy notice.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The personal data we need</h2>
        <p class="govuk-body">The personal data we need about the angler is:</p>

        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">

            <li>date of birth</li>
            <li>contact details including phone number, email address or both</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="govuk-body">We process this personal data because it is necessary to process the application for a licence. If you don't provide this information then we can't issue a licence.</p>
        <p class="govuk-body">The lawful basis we rely on to process your personal data is article 6(1)(e) of the UK GDPR, which allows us to process personal data when this is necessary to exercise our official authority set out in law (in this case the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975).</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you have a disability and would like to be issued with a disabled licence, you can voluntarily provide us with your:</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">If you would like to receive marketing emails from us you can sign up to receive our email newsletter.</p>

        <p class="govuk-body">The lawful basis we rely on for processing this special category personal data is your explicit consent under article 6(1)(a) and 9(2)(a) of the UK GDPR. We will only use this personal data to assess your eligibility for a disabled licence. Consent can be withdrawn at any time.</p>
